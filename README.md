## Why?

"Science isn't about why, it's about why not." - Cave Johnson

## What?

This project is to *sort of* revive GoldSrc bhop/surf mapping by porting them to a more modern engine. It's currently just a proof of concept, with a single map; but I'll be providing updates, and the project's source code soon.

I'm planning to keep an eye on the community to see what's the demand for a project like this, and if there are other projects like mine that I could be looking for.

I haven't made much research, I just wanted to make something in 1-2 days, and this is what I've come up with.

## Questions you may have

**When is it going to be open-source?**
*First I would like to refactor the code, and clean up features, so other developers would have an easier time adding their features to the project.*

**Why didn't you use Unity or Unreal Engine 4?**
*This is just a proof of concept, if there is going to be a demand for this to be ported to another, more polished engine, I might port it to UE4. However, the simplicity that Godot provides is comfortable for me, and I would rather make this version better than making spagetti code in another engine.*

## TODO
- Timer
- Map/checkpoint editor
